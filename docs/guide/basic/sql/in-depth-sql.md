# In Depth SQL

## Why SQL?

SQL is a declarative query language. It is a language that transforms your data into a format that is more convenient for your application to handle. Unlike NoSQL paradigms, the way you access data is separate from the way you store data.

<!-- > Nowadays, it's quite popular to say that REST APIs are the dire way to access data, or GraphQL is the way to go, [but] SQL [serves basically the same role]. It's just that SQL is more mature and more powerful.

## Learn PostgreSQL

You don't need to know any database administration to use Supabase. This is one of the main selling points â€” connection pooling, creating tables, and making backups are either accessible from the dashboard or is directly built into Supabase. Common tasks such as managing extensions all have a GUI on the Supabase dashboard, and the default installation comes with sensible defaults.

While the Supabase clients libraries can quickly get you started on a project, you'll need to know SQL to take advantage of indexing, views, common table expressions, triggers, stored procedures, and much more. At the minimum, you'll need a basic understanding of data modeling in SQL to take advantage of the relational model.

The most effective way to learn SQL is to work through the exercises from [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/gettingstarted.html). Reference the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) and the [Official Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/) for help if you get stuck.
