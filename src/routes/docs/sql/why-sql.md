# Why SQL?

SQL is a declarative query language. It is a language that transforms your data into a format that is more convenient for your application to handle. Unlike NoSQL paradigms, the way you access data is separate from the way you store data.

> Nowadays, it's quite popular to say that REST APIs are the dire way to access data, or GraphQL is the way to go, [but] SQL [serves basically the same role]. It's just that SQL is more mature and more powerful.
