## Learn PostgreSQL

You don't need to know any database administration if you use Supabase. This is one of the main selling point -- connection pooling, creating roles, and backups are built into Supabase. Common tasks such as managing extensions all have a GUI on the Supabase dashboard, and there are already sensible defaults.

The quickest way to learn SQL is to work through the exercises from [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/gettingstarted.html). Search through [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) for help if you get stuck. If you want to go in depth on specifics, reference the [Official Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/).
