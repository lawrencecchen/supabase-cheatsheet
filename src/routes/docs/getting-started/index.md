# Getting Started

## Learn PostgreSQL

You don't need to know any database administration if you use Supabase. This is one of the main selling point -- connection pooling, creating roles, and backups are built into Supabase. Common tasks such as managing extensions all have a GUI on the Supabase dashboard, and there are already sensible defaults.

While the Supabase clients libraries can quickly get you started on a project, you'll need to know SQL to take advantage of indexing, views, recursive CTEs, triggers, stored procedures, and much more. At the minimum, you'll need a basic understanding of data modeling in SQL.

The most effective way to learn SQL is to work through the exercises from [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/gettingstarted.html). Reference the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) and the [Official Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/) for help if you get stuck.
